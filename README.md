# Machine Learning ðŸ¤–
This repository contains the optional homework to get additional points for the final exam.  
This exam was inserted in my study plan as an external one from Robotics and AI (Professor Luca Iocchi).  

Each homework contains a pdf report and the python code used to solve the tasks. I started using colab after the first hw since it's so much better.

## Homework 1
Multiclass classification with any prefered model.  
The only requirement was to compare 2 different models for each dataset.  
Both datasets were balanced with 5000 instances per class, 10 classes for a total of 50k elements.  
The elements of the datasets were feature vector of dimension d, specifically 100 for dataset 1 and 1000 for dataset 2.
